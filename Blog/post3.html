                <h1>What is Virtual Reality? Everything You Need to Know...</h1>
                <img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="VR Headset" width="90%">
                <h4>BY Roque Acop<br><em>Long read</em></h4>

                <p>Unlike AR, virtual reality creates a fully immersive experience using a headset and computer-generated images (CGI) to put the user in a virtual world. In VR, the user interacts with a fully virtual world using a headset and a controller. Virtual reality creates a sensory experience by stimulating and tricking the sensory organs into interacting with the virtual world as they would the physical world.</p>

                <h3>What is Virtual Reality Used For?</h3>
                <p>Virtual reality has many uses similar to AR, but creating an entirely virtual experience lends itself to different types of applications. Industries that use VR include entertainment, health care, training, and education. Letâ€™s examine the uses of VR in each industry.</p>

                <h3>Entertainment:</h3>
                <p>VR in entertainment creates ways to access movies, places, and video games in full 360 degrees. It gives users the ability to look where they want and what they want in virtual environments, creating a new experience.</p>

                <h3>Health Care:</h3>
                <p>VR in health care gives surgeons and those training in the medical field the ability to watch surgery simulations, learn about tools, and experience patient dynamics in a virtual setting before undergoing surgery.</p>

                <h3>Training:</h3>
                <p>VR simulations can help with training for new drivers as the virtual environment is safer and more accessible than learning to drive in the physical world.</p>

                <h3>Education:</h3>
                <p>VR in education brings students into other environments to get a clear picture of what they are learning about, making it more exciting. Additionally, it could make remote learning easier as students could participate in a virtual classroom.</p>

                <h3>Advantages of Virtual Reality</h3>
                <p>VR has advantages similar to AR, including its advantages in education by allowing learners to explore the physical world in ways not possible without virtual reality. VR gives users a safe space to experience or train for things that might be dangerous or fearful in the physical world without putting them in harm's way. VR also allows users to travel anywhere in the physical world through a virtual experience.</p>

                <h3>Disadvantages of Virtual Reality</h3>
                <p>One disadvantage of VR is motion sickness, which some users experience. It creates nausea, dizziness, and headaches for some users. VR motion sickness occurs in users with a predisposition to motion sickness or prolonged experience in a simulation. Challenges in VR hardware and cost make it harder to implement than AR. In addition to the upfront cost of the headset, VR requires you to already have a computer with a high-end graphics card to run VR software.</p>
