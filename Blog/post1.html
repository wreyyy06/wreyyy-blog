                <h1>Top 10 most innovative companies in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality of 2023</h1>
                <img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Top 10" width="90%">
                <p>BY Lesly Ann Garachico<br>
                    <em>Long read</em>
                </p>
                
                <p>Explore the full 2023 list of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, featuring 540 organizations that are reshaping industries and culture. We’ve highlighted the firms making the biggest impact across 54 categories, including artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and more.</p>
                
                <p>The metaverse—and by extension, the mixed-reality headgear that might be used to access it—had a moment in the spotlight in 2021. This surge in interest was partly due to the social isolation of the pandemic and partly due to Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to rebrand Facebook as Meta, betting on a future immersed in virtual spaces. However, much of the excitement around an immersive virtual public space has faded, as it became clear that the hardware, software, and standards necessary to realize this vision are not yet fully developed.</p>
                
                <p>As public interest shifted, consumer enthusiasm for augmented and virtual reality seemed to cool. In the U.S., for example, sales of VR headsets declined by 2% year-over-year as of early December 2022, following a year of doubling sales in 2021, according to research from NPD Group. Nonetheless, tech companies—both large and small—continue to invest substantial resources and top talent into spatial computing devices and experiences.</p>
                
                <p>Despite incurring a $10 billion loss on its Reality Labs business in 2021, Meta has indicated that it plans to continue spending at a similar rate to advance its VR, AR, and metaverse aspirations. The company set a new benchmark in VR headsets with its Quest Pro, which features enhanced pass-through imaging, new eye-tracking technology, and improved hand controllers.</p>
